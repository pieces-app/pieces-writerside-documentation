## Countless Google Searches, Open Tab Back-and-Forth & History Scrolling 
More and more developer resources live online nowadays - tutorial sites, Stack Overflow posts, documentation & open source packages, wikis & blog posts - the list goes on and on.
- This, combined with the constant switching back to the IDE and other tools, often causes developers to lose track of where they were and start over again at the search bar.

## Resurfacing Additional Context in Collaborative Environments
Task and project context regarding the who, what, where, and why is often discussed over a variety of channels such as Email, Slack, Teams, Discord, Community Forums, Twitter, Reddit, and more.
- Keeping track of this critical context - decision outcomes, architectures, implementation solutions, best practices, power tips, configs - is becoming harder than ever.
