## Inserting a saved Code Snippet at your Current Cursor Location
![](INSERT_AT_SNIPPET.gif)
- When you're ready to reuse a snippet, we offer a variety of ways to quickly access and insert snippets into your active file. In addition to [**Auto-Complete**](reuse-saved-materials-with-atomic-auto-complete.md "Atomic Auto Complete") or [**Global Search**](global-search-sort-via-suggestions-reference-and-reuse-saved-materials.md "Global Search and Suggestion") using the command palette, users also enjoy the ability to insert a saved snippet at their cursor location via right-clicking on the snippet in the List View.


## Editing saved Code Snippets and Text Notes
![](EDIT_SNIPPET_JETBRAINS.gif)
- As we progress deeper into our projects, frameworks and dependencies often change, which means we might need to adjust a saved snippet to comply with breaking changes or conform to new standards. Right-click on a snippet in the List View and select "Edit" to quickly and easily edit a saved snippet so your code can stay relevant and up-to-date.


## Renaming a Saved Material
![](RENAME_SNIPPET_JETBRAINS.gif)
- We're on a mission to make it as frictionless as possible for our users to save snippets without disrupting their flow. The AI in Pieces for Developers will attempt to add a relevant name for your snippets automatically, so you don't have to. Don't worry, you can rename your snippets any time to a convention that works best for you— All you need to do is right-click a snippet in the List View and select "Rename".


## Reclassifying a Code Snippets' Language Association
![](RECLASSIFY_SNIPPET.gif)
- When you save a material to Pieces for Developers, our AI works hard to understand what you saved so that we can successfully add as much helpful metadata - tags, related links & websites, related people, etc. - as possible.
> One of our fundamental capabilities is Instant Language Detection, which automatically detects the language of your snippet and supports over 35 programming languages, including Typescript, Javascript, Python, Dart, C++, C#, and many more. 

- Unfortunately, we don't always get it right, so we made it as easy as possible to reclassify a snippet to the proper language. Simply right-click a snippet in the List View and select "Reclassify".


## Save a snippet with “Save to Pieces as…” in the JetBrains Plugin

- Save exactly what you want super quickly with “Save to Pieces as…” When you select this option from the right-click context menu, a dialogue window will pop up with pre-generated context, e.g., a title, tags, a description, related links, related people and more. From that window, you can edit all of the contextual metadata of your snippet and then hit "Save".


## Deleting a Saved Material
![](DELETE_SNIPPET.gif)
- Since we made it so simple to save snippets from the [**browser**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pieces-save-code-snippets/igbgibhbfonhmjlechmeefimncpekepm), your IDE, and using our [Flagship Desktop App](https://code.pieces.app/install), users are saving hundreds of snippets throughout their time researching, coding, and collaborating. For some, this can get a little chaotic. If you'd like to do a little spring cleaning, you can delete snippets by right-clicking a snippet in the List View and selecting "Delete".


## Connecting Custom Cloud Domain

Sharing materials using Pieces for Developers is about more than sharing the material itself: It's about sharing the material and all the contextual metadata associated with it - where it came from, what it does, how to use it, the people associated with it, and more. What's unique about our shareable links and sharing with Pieces for Developers is all of our users receive their own, dedicated cloud, that is isolated from other users.
> View this [Shared Python Snippet](https://python.pieces.cloud/?p=8711459369) from [python.pieces.cloud](https://python.pieces.cloud/?p=8711459369) in your browser. Notice this is from the custom domain, "python".

You can _personalize your cloud domain_ with a custom name, like **https://mack.pieces.cloud**. Now, when you generate and share a link, your link will include your personalized domain, so users know exactly who it came from.
To personalize your cloud domain, open the [**Pieces for Developers | Desktop App**](managing-and-updating-your-saved-resources.md#connecting-custom-cloud-domain) and navigate to the settings menu.
> Updating your personal cloud domain can take up to 15 minutes. Don't worry, we will notify you when this is complete.
