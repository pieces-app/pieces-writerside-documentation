## **I’m in JetBrains and I keep getting the notification “Can’t Connect to Pieces OS”. What do I do?**
- Restart Pieces OS. After a couple of seconds, re-open Pieces for JetBrains.
## **How are my snippets suggested in the snippet list view?**
- Similar to the Pieces for Developers' "filter by suggested" view, The Pieces for JetBrains Suggested Snippet List View returns a list of existing snippets that are perceived as relavent to the user's current project.
- It's important to understand that these *suggested snippets are existing snippets from your Pieces for Developers repository.* The suggested snippet view does not suggest new snippets, but instead resurfaces relavent snippets that were already saved to Pieces for Developers.
## **What is Pieces OS? How does it work?**
- Pieces OS is the background service that enables Pieces to work locally and handles communications with any integrations. Without Pieces OS, Pieces for Developers will not be able to save your snippets or interact with any of your plugins.
- Pieces OS also lets you sync Pieces to the cloud so that you can access your data anywhere. In addition, it enables our other cloud-based features, like link sharing. Download and install Pieces OS! Head over to [https://code.pieces.app/install](https://code.pieces.app/install) to get started.
## **How do I share a snippet from my JetBrains IDE?**
- To share a snippet, you must be connected to Pieces OS and logged in and connected to the Pieces cloud. Then, right-click the snippet you’d like to share and select “share via Pieces link”. Just copy the shareable link and send it to anyone!
