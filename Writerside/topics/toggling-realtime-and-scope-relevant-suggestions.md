The demands on developers is increasing every day. As a result, a developer's time is becoming ever more precious and anything that boosts productivity is no longer a nice-to-have, but a need-to-have.
With that, our team has invested serious resources enabling Pieces for Developers to proactively suggest the most relevant materials at the right time.
