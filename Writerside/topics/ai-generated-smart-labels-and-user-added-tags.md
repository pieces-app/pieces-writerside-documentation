Doubling down on our efforts to make search and suggestion world-class, Pieces for Developers ships with an offline and on-device ML Material Labeling model that automatically generates smart tags for everything you save:

> **HTTP Request, Flutter Framework, Dart Project, Conditional For Loop**

- In addition to our auto-generated smart tags, our Context Awareness Engine automatically layers in tags that correspond to origin details and related links.
Lastly, you can easily add your own tags as a manual way to further organize your saved resources while driving a more personalized search and suggestion experience.
