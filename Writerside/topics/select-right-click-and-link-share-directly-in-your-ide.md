[//]: # (title: Select Right Click and Link Share Directly in Your IDE)

![](SHARE_LINK_JETBRAINS.gif)

Effortlessly share code snippets, screenshots, and other resources with a personalized access link i.e. *YOUR_USERNAME.pieces.cloud*, in just a few steps. 

- When you select a resource within your IDE and generate a shareable link, that resource along with all of its useful context gets uploaded to your private Pieces for Developers Cloud.
From there, those with the link will be able to access what you shared and its context metadata, even if the recipient doesn't have Pieces for Developers themselves.

- Further, if you edit the resource or add additional context metadata [Pieces for Developers](context-awareness-engine-and-origin-details.md "Context Information") will recommend that you update the link or automatically update it for you. 
> This happens in the background without generating a new access link meaning previous recipients can stay up to date, and you don't have to re-share.
Lastly, we know that accidental shares happen and permission levels can change. With that, you can always revoke a shareable link at any time.
