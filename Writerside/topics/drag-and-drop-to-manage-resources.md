[//]: # (title: Drag and Drop to Manage Resources)

Saving, reclassifying, and reusing code in the Pieces for Developers | JetBrains Plugin is pretty simple, but it’s even simpler when all you have to do is drag a snippet around your JetBrains IDE. There are three specific features supported by Drag and Drop:

- **Create a snippet**: Highlight some code in your editor and drag it to the Pieces window to save it as a new snippet. Pieces automatically associates all of the usual context with the new snippet, but if you want to ensure that it’s classified as a certain language, just drag it to that section of the List View.

- **Reuse a Snippet**: It just got super simple to place a snippet exactly where you want it in your editor. Just drag a snippet from your Pieces list to wherever you want it to be, then keep on coding.

- **Reclassify a Snippet**: Along with classifying a new snippet, dragging an existing snippet from one language to another will automatically reclassify it. These changes are reflected in the Pieces desktop app, as well!
