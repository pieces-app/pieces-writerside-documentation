[//]: # (title: Use Cases)

## Countless Google Searches, Open Tab Back-and-Forth & History Scrolling 
More and more developer resources live online nowadays - tutorial sites, Stack Overflow posts, documentation & open source packages, wikis & blog posts - the list goes on and on.
- This, combined with the constant switching back to the IDE and other tools, often causes developers to lose track of where they were and start over again at the search bar.
>  [Pieces for Developers | Desktop App](https://code.pieces.app/install) ships with a first-in-kind [Workflow Activity Stream](workflow-activity-stream-and-process-backtracking.md "Workflow Activity Stream") that lets you pick up where you left off faster than ever.


## Resurfacing Additional Context in Collaborative Environments
Task and project context regarding the who, what, where, and why is often discussed over a variety of channels, such as Email, Slack, Teams, Discord, Community Forums, Twitter, Reddit, and more.
- Keeping track of this critical context - decision outcomes, architectures, implementation solutions, best practices, power tips, configs - is becoming harder than ever.
>   When you save code snippets with the **Pieces for Developers | JetBrains Plugin** it internally leverages our unique [**Context Awareness Engine**](context-awareness-engine-and-origin-details.md) to automatically extract and associate over 15 metadata heuristics.
>   The **Pieces for Developers | Desktop App** enables you to [**Toggle Realtime and Scope-Relevant Suggestions**](toggling-realtime-and-scope-relevant-suggestions.md "Toggle Realtime Suggestions") around materials to save, reference, reuse, and share.


## Onboarding New Developers, Reducing Technical Debt & Code Reviews
- Developers continuously have to navigate ever-growing code bases, backlog tasks, Jira Tickets, GitHub Issues, and Pull Requests, all in an effort to reuse existing code, onboard new developers faster, share relevant examples, reduce technical debt, and drive code standardization.
> Powered by our [**On-Device Proactive Save & Pattern Engine**](suggested-save-and-on-device-pattern-engine.md "Suggested Save"), the **Pieces for Developers | JetBrains Plugin** can automatically recognize and save highly reusable, yet complementary materials for you.
> Leverage the [**Pieces for Developers | Desktop App**](https://code.pieces.app/install) to discover and extract reusable boilerplate through our [**In-Project Snippet Discovery**](in-project-snippet-discovery.md "In Project Snippet Discovery") features, which run entirely offline and on-device.
