[//]: # (title: Accessing Saved Material Overviews from the in IDE List View)

![](TREE_VIEW_JETBRAINS.gif)

In addition to [Global Search](global-search-sort-via-suggestions-reference-and-reuse-saved-materials.md "Global Search"), [Scope-Relevant Suggestions](suggested-save-and-on-device-pattern-engine.md "Suggested Save"), and [Atomic Auto-Complete](reuse-saved-materials-with-atomic-auto-complete.md "Reuse Saved Materials"), we wanted to make it easy to view and access all of your saved materials, and their associated metadata, directly from within your IDE.

- When you install the JetBrains Plugin, a tool tab with the Pieces logo is added to the left-hand side of JetBrains. This is where you can view all of your saved resources; further, open them for referencing in a generated Material Overview Markdown, and sign in to set up your private cloud for sharing.
