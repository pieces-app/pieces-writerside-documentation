Between our [Flagship Desktop App](https://code.pieces.app/install), [Chromium-Based Browser Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pieces-save-code-snippets/igbgibhbfonhmjlechmeefimncpekepm), and the [JetBrains Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17328-pieces--save-search-share--reuse-code-snippets), our users are saving more than ever. That said, a large part of our material enrichment efforts are allocated towards making searches and suggestions first-class.
With these end goals in mind, Pieces for Developers ships with an offline and on-device ML Material Description model that generates a smart description for everything you save:
> **Smart Description: What the code snippet or resource is, what it does, how to use it, and how it might be used in the future.**

- These smart descriptions, coupled with relevant commit messages extracted via our Context Awareness Engine, enable awesome reference and reuse experiences later on in a user's workflow.
