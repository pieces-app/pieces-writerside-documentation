These days, technical work is more people-centric than ever. Writing and reviewing code, upskilling on ever-evolving best practices, migrating to new framework versions, and onboarding new developers; it all builds on the work of others.
- Simply knowing who to reach out to for additional context, who to add as a reviewer on pull requests, or who could provide a different perspective can save some serious time and prevent major headaches.

> To help solve this dilemma, our Context Awareness Engine automatically associates Relevant Collaborators, Maintainers, and Content Authors with the resources you save.
