[//]: # (title: Stay in Flow With Single Click Save)

![](SAVE_AND_RENAME_JETBRAINS.gif)

We are making a continuous effort to provide our users with frictionless ways to save key workflow materials. Stay in the flow with our **JetBrains Plugin** and simply select a code snippet or a resource in your file tree, right-click, and select "Save to Pieces".
Save all types of resources. It's better to have a resource available and not need it than need it and not have it!

> **i.e. Boilerplate/Reference Snippets, Common Bash/Powershell Commands, CI/CD Configurations, HTTP Requests, Screenshots, Architecture/UML Diagrams, Text Notes, and so much more.**
