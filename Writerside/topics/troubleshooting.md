### Solving Common [**Connectivity Issues**](#solving-common-connectivity-issues)
If you run into issues where your **Pieces for Developers | JetBrains Plugin** is having trouble connecting to Pieces for Developers | OS Server, try to restart Pieces for Developers | OS Server and then your JetBrains IDE and try again.
- If the issue persists, try clicking the Refresh button at the top of the List View to re-attempt the connection. If that still fails, don't hesitate to contact us at [**support@pieces.app**](mailto:support@pieces.app) or fill out [**this form**](https://getpieces.typeform.com/to/mCjBSIjF?os=9a9bc924-80cf-4f66-b7e8-da6526e0a5d0&user=85d3a788-9617-4a31-862b-bc26c649acca).
