[//]: # (title: Suggested Snippets Right Inside Your IDE)

![](SUGGESTED_SNIPPETS_JETBRAINS.gif)

Use your snippets when they are the most relevant to you! We know how important it is to stay in your workflow and not have to go searching to find the right snippet. 

- The Pieces for JetBrains Suggested Snippet List View returns a list of existing snippets that are perceived as relevant to your current flow through AI generated metadata and automatic language detection and context.
> The suggested snippet view does not suggest new snippets, but instead resurfaces relevant snippets that were already saved to Pieces for Developers.
