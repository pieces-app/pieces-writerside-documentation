It's often the case that you only realize you should have saved a resource at the moment you realize you didn't save it. To help with this phenomenon, our **JetBrains Plugin** learns from your workflow behaviors and can proactively save things for you.
- Our offline-first and on-device Pattern Engine runs in the background and can pick up on your workflow patterns and recognize snippets that you’re frequently reusing; if you don’t have similar snippets already saved, our platform will automatically save these high-reuse snippets for you.
