As a result of automatic material enrichment, Pieces associates a ton of helpful metadata with each saved material. With that, you can mix and match different search preferences and result display modes in a way that best matches your search style.
From the Pieces for JetBrains settings, you can choose the following search result actions:
- Open the snippet (default)
- Insert the snippet
- Open the snippet and copy it to your clipboard 
- Copy the snippet to your clipboard 
  - To insert the snippet you just searched for, hold ⌥ option on MacOS or Alt on Windows and click where you’d like the snippet to be. This makes it easier and faster to reference snippets without the time-consuming steps of navigating to the settings view.
