![](ACTIVITY_VIEW_CHROME_AND_DESKTOP_APP.gif)

Picking up where you left off and getting back into flow are some of the largest productivity bottlenecks throughout a developer's workflow. Our team is hard at work making it easier than ever to backtrack through your work-in-progress journey.

- Our Workflow Activity Stream enables you to quickly find and access useful context metadata that's been associated with your saved materials. 
> Workflow details and points of reference such as related links, shared snippets, relevant tags, collaborators, and more are all available as a scrollable timeline right within our [Flagship Desktop App](https://code.pieces.app/install).
