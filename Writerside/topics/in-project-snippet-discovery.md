[//]: # (title: In Project Snippet Discovery)

[Pieces for Developers](https://code.pieces.app) is the first developer tool in the world to ingest an entire code base and return hyper-specific, highly-reusable code snippets entirely offline and on-device. 

Running [**Snippet Discovery**](https://youtu.be/pFvMxo___Rw) on a local source repository has huge benefits:
- **Discover highly reusable snippets resulting in less time spent re-writing the same code from scratch over and over**
- **Driving code standardization within and across projects**
- **Discover reference snippets and share them with your team or use them to onboard new developers faster than ever**
