[//]: # (title: Context Awareness Engine and Origin Details)

![](SNIPPET_CONTEXT_VIEW.png){width="700"}

Reference code is everywhere these days. Whether it's a solution that you're adapting from Stack Overflow or doc-site boilerplate sent over Slack or Microsoft Teams, all code comes from somewhere.
- Where a code snippet came from, and the larger context it was taken out of, is often lost when saving or sharing reference materials today and makes it incredibly difficult to find and share or reuse it later on.
In an effort to maintain this invaluable context, Pieces for Developers automatically extracts and associates useful origin details every time you save a resource.
