[//]: # (title: Access and Save Offline Shared Links)

![](SAVE_FROM_WEB.gif)

Although it's not necessary to have [Pieces for Developers](https://code.pieces.app/install) installed when accessing a shared resource, we don't want our users to have to switch back and forth to the browser or to need to keep track of all the shared links that you've received.

- Simply click the **_Save to Pieces_** button located at the top of the [Sharing Preview Web App](personalized-link-sharing-of-saved-materials-and-their-context-metadata.md), and you're good to go! You can now access and reuse the locally saved resource in our Flagship Desktop App or directly in your IDE with the JetBrains Plugin.

> Recipients that have the Pieces for Developers Desktop App can easily save a copy of the shared resource to their own Pieces for Developers drive for offline search, suggestion, and reuse later on.
