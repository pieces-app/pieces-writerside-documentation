![](SORT_JETBRAINS.gif)

The demands on developers increase every day. As a result, a developer's time is becoming ever more precious and anything that boosts productivity is no longer a nice-to-have, but a need-to-have.
With that, our team has invested serious resources into enabling Pieces for Developers to proactively suggest the most relevant materials at the right time.
- Complementing [Proactive Save](suggested-save-and-on-device-pattern-engine.md "Suggested Save") in the [JetBrains Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17328-pieces--save-search-share--reuse-code-snippets), we're excited to for you to check out [Sorting via Suggestions](global-search-sort-via-suggestions-reference-and-reuse-saved-materials.md "Global Search"), which is based on your recently saved materials, available in our [Flagship Desktop App](getting-started.md).
